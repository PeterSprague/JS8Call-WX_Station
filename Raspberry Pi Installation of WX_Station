Installation on a Raspberry Pi

Download and unzip the folder from github

In the newly created folder, there should be wx_station-0.1.py and js8net.py.

Start JS8Call

Start wx_station-0.1.py. I recommend running the script in Thonny. 

You should see in Thonny:

Connecting to JS8Call...
Connected.
F1ZXO WX Station Active...

In the script, you will find

trigger = 'RAPPORT?'
You may change this trigger if you wish.

From another JS8Call station, send a directed message to the F1ZXO station with the trigger word.

Example:

F1ZXO RAPPORT?

F1ZXO should respond by sending a message to the inbox of the requesting station.
